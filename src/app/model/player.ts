  /**
   * calculateAdjustedSpeed - Calculates the adjusted speed for a player based on their current position, velocity, and target(s).
   *
   * Logic Phases:
   * 1. Accelerate: The player starts from their current position and accelerates until reaching the maximum speed.
   * 2. Maintain Max Speed: The player maintains the maximum speed if the distance to the next target(s) is greater than the stopping distance.
   * 3. Decelerate: Begins to slow down to either stop at the final target or adjust speed according to the angle between successive targets.
   *
   * Scenarios:
   * - Single Target: The player needs to come to a full stop at the next target.
   * - Multiple Targets:
   *    - If angle between successive targets is 0 degrees: Maximum speed.
   *    - If angle is 90 degrees: Complete stop before moving to the next target.
   *    - If angle is between 0 and 90: Speed is adjusted based on `accelerationWeight * (1 - angle / 90)`.
   *
   * Exit Conditions:
   * 1. All targets processed.
   * 2. Distance to n-th target is greater than stopping distance.
   * 3. Max accelerationWeight becomes 0.
